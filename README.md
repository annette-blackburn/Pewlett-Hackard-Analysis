# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis 

# Purpose: 
To help prepare Pewlett Hackard for the upcoming "silver tsunami," this analysis determines who will be retiring in the next years and how many positions Pewlett Hackard will need to fill by creating a list of all employees who are eligible for retirement and another list of how many job titles will be open after this upcoming generation retires.

# Results:

## Retirement Eligibility Results:
### Total Employees Eligible: 
90,398 employees are eligible for retirement, which is roughly 30% of Pewlett Hackard's employees

### Positions: 
The job positions that will need to be filled include Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager.

### Titles: 
Of those eligible for retirement, nearly 60,000 hold the titles of "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff." 

### Departments: 
The top three departments with the greatest number of possible retirees are: 
    1. Development (approximately 25%)
    2. Production (approximately 22%)
    3. Sales (approximately 7%) 

## Mentorship Eligibility Results:
Of the roughly 300,000 employees, only 1,549 qualify for mentorship or training for an internal promotion.

Ultimately, *90,398* roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact and *there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of PH employees*; however, there are not enough employees who qualify for mentorship for an internal promotion (only 1,549).
